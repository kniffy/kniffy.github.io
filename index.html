this is a short writeup of my notes from tinkering with the old netbsd
for playstation 2, which i never succeeded in getting to work, but the
resources i found seem extremely rare at this point, so here i am writing
this up now.
	</p>

<!--
	<p>
most of my time spent tinkering was actually on ps2 linux, which i did
get working, and even compiled some stuff for, such as an ftp server,
which was all running smoothly on the official sony hard drive.

see my <a href="https://tildas.org/files/ps2-netbsd.tzst">ps2-netbsd.tzst</a> file for an archive of the only compiled snapshots
i was able to find, courtesy an old japanese bsd users group that i don't
recall the name of.. (someone do let me know what it was)
	</p>

	<p>
see the <a href="https://kernelloader.sourceforge.net/linux.html">kernelloader</a> 
project for some info on booting an OS.. one needs a screen with
sync-on-green, and a VGA cable, since netbsd only supports SVGA for video
output. i'm not sure if this is an inherent netbsd quirk, or a limitation of
this loader, but either way i would like to see a freshly written loader, this
one i found to be overly complex to use

	<p>
in new developments since my time exploring in 2020, seemingly there is
code and packages on the netbsd servers, so perhaps netbsd 9 is working?:

	<p>
given the existence of the <a href="https://cturt.github.io/freedvdboot.html">freedvdboot</a> exploit,
the dream is for a netbsd livecd to be created, similar to what can be done
for the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAYgI1mfSd0">dreamcast</a>. if netbsd 9 indeed works, this will make it a much better
system than the now very ancient ps2 linux systems
