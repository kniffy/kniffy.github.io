this is a short writeup of my experience tinkering with the old netbsd
for playstation 2, which i never succeeded in getting to work, but the
resources i found seem extremely rare at this point, so here i am writing
this up now.
	</p>

	<p>
most of my time spent tinkering was actually on ps2 linux, which i did
get working, and even compiled some stuff for, such as an ftp server,
which was all running smoothly on the official sony hard drive.

	<p>
see my ps2-netbsd.tzst file for an archive of the only compiled snapshots
i was able to find, courtesy an old japanese bsd users group that i don't
recall the name of.. (someone do let me know what it was)
	</p>

	<p>
see the <a href="https://kernelloader.sourceforge.net/linux.html">kernelloader</a> 
project for a loader to actually boot netbsd.. one needs a screen with
sync-on-green, and a VGA cable, since netbsd only supports SVGA for video
output
	</p>

	<p>
in new developments since my time exploring in 2020, seemingly there is
code and packages on the netbsd servers:

	<p>
<a id="ftp" href="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/sys/arch/playstation2/">https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/sys/arch/playstation2/</a>
<br><br>
<a id="ftp" href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/playstation2/">https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/playstation2/</a>
	</p>

	<p>
so perhaps netbsd 9 is working?
	</p>

	<p>
given the existence of the freedvdboot exploit, seen here:
	</p>

	<p>
<a id="ftp" href="https://cturt.github.io/freedvdboot.html">https://cturt.github.io/freedvdboot.html</a>
	</p>

	<p>
the dream is for a netbsd livecd to be created, similar to wot is possible
for the dreamcast. if netbsd 9 indeed works, this will make it a much better
system than the now very ancient ps2 linux systems
