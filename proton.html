	<p>
this is an informal collection of my notes during my time as a beta tester for
Team Fortress 2 Classic. various issues and bugs were encountered, and maybe
this will serve as a crash course reference to debugging games in proton
	</p>

	<p><b>attaching gdb, or, why the hell does the game crash?</b></p>

	<p>
it turns out to be relatively simple to get a debugger running on a game in
proton.
	</p>

	<p>
<code>PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1</code> needs to be in your game's launch options
	</p>

	<p>
with that set, navigate a shell to <code>/tmp/proton_&lt;username&gt;</code> and
you'll find several helpful scripts, like <code>gdb_run</code>, which will
launch and attach the debugger to the game's process
	</p>

	<p>
for flatpak users, these scripts are in something like
<code>/home/&lt;username&gt;/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.cache/tmp/proton_&lt;username&gt;</code>
	</p>

	<p><b>file descriptor gremlins, or, eventfd: Too many open files</b></p>

<!--	<p>
one of the early major issues i ran into was a mysterious quirk where the game
would run for a bit, maybe 20 minutes or so before crashing, seemingly without
any rhyme or reason.
	</p> -->

	<p>
as it turns out Proton uses ESYNC, a synchronization based on eventfd, which
creates file descriptors, of which there is a maximum amount that can be
created. normally you would think this is a Large Number&trade; but on my
system this was only 4096, meaning rather quickly i would exhaust all
descriptors and crash.
	</p>

	<p>
for further reading see 
<a id="ftp" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/blob/proton_8.0/README.esync">README.esync</a>
	</p>

	<h6>solution 1</h6>
	<p>
upgrade to linux kernel 5.16 or greater, for FSYNC mode, which is based on
futex2. Proton should automatically detect this and utilize it, and one can
confirm this by checking proton logs for the line <code>fsync: up and running.</code>
	</p>

	<p>
see <a id="ftp" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/futex2.html">futex2.html</a>
for further reading
	</p>

	<h6>solution 2</h6>
	<p>
raise your system's number of file descriptors. even if you use kernel 5.16 or
greater, it's probably a good idea to raise this. systemd distros probably
have a Large Number&trade; by default. other systems probably define
this in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>
	</p>

	<p>
add a line like <code>* hard nofile 1048576</code>
	</p>

	<p>
note that if you are running the flatpak version of steam, you may need to
check the file descriptor limits within the container, though it <i>should</i>
inherit the value of the host system
